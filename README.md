Convert old RPG Maker tilesets to RPG Maker MV tileset format.

Supported tilesets (with varying  degrees of success):
 - 95
 - Sim 95 (97)
 - Alpha for Mobile
 - 2000/2003
 - XP
 - VX/Ace
 
 It also includes an option to define the size of the tile so you can try convert non rpg maker tilesets. 

## How to use

The program is split in two tabs, the converter and the editor. There is also a button labeled *split and save* which crops each tile from the given tileset and saves into individual image files.  

**Converter**  

Tilecon's raison d'Ãªtre. It takes a tileset as input and reorganize the tiles in a way that RMMV undertand. You can set if you want the tiles to be aligned into the sides, center or have them strenched and set a color to be used as transparency.   

**Editor**

It's like the converter but interactive. You can choose individually which tiles you want to place in the output tileset image having the aligment and streching options separated to each tile.  

## Running

You will need to have ``.NET Framework`` version 4.6.1 or higher installed. Open tilecon.sln with Visual Studio and you ready to go (or build it with MSBuild).
